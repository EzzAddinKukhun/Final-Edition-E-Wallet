## 1.5. notes 
this project was conducted using an agile method called scrum , although we encountered a lot of management related problems , we tried our best to keep it together , the main problem was how to divide the work between 6 different programmers while the project have a capacity of 3 at most .
we conducted a meeting every 4 days which all the parties would join and discuss the outline of the project and the outline of the sprint it self 
we had other problems such as the technical problems of working on different IDE's and needing different software resources 
one last problem was the owner of the product didn't have a full time commitment to the project , due to lack of time , which is a necessity  to the agile method .
